# Quick Start

## Our Story

It started with questions any curious person should be asking: *Why is there so much complexity in development?* *How can we lower the bar of development?* *What is the future of programming?* High-level languages created 100x the number of developers while simultaneously making development 100x easier. We believe it's time to think beyond high-level languages and look towards a new language built on the cloud, for the cloud, that transforms the industry like high-level languages once did.

‚ú®Storyscript is the **polyglot, cloud-native programming language of the future**.<br>

## Getting started

The goal of the quick start is to get a Storyscript application deployed to Kubernetes in **under 5 minutes**. Start the clock! ‚è∞

First, install our CLI:

<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center" width="100%" valign="top" colspan="2">
<h2><img src="../assets/apple-logo.svg" width="15"> macOS</h2>

```bash
brew install storyscript/brew/story
```

</td>
<!--
<td style="text-align:center" width="50%" valign="top">
<h2><img src="../assets/windows-logo.svg" width="15"> Windows</h2>

Download the appropriate installer:

<div><a href="https://github.com/asyncy/cli/releases/download/0.0.6/asyncy-x64.exe" class="button">64-bit installer</a></div>
<div><a href="#" class="button">32-bit installer</a></div>

</td>
-->
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center" width="50%" valign="top">
<h2><img src="../assets/ubuntu-logo.svg" width="15"> Ubuntu 16+</h2>



<a href="https://snapcraft.io/story">
  <img alt="Get it from the Snap Store" src="https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-white.svg" />
</a>

<small style="display:block; width: 100%"><a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Snap is available on other Linux OS.</a></small>

</td>
<td style="text-align:center" width="50%" valign="top">
<h2>Direct from Python</h2>

```bash
pip install --user story
```

<small>Python 3.6 or higher is required, thus on Debian/Ubuntu use `pip3`.</small>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

Next, login with your GitHub account:

```bash
story login
```

All done! üí™ You're all set to create and deploy your apps.


## Write your first Story

Let's create your first application. First, create a new folder for your application.

```bash
mkdir first_app && cd first_app
```
```bash
story apps create
```

> This command generated a `story.yml` file which is used to identify your application and provide metadata to configure version and secrets variables.

We have created a few examples that can help you bootstrap your project. Let's start you off with the classic hello-world:

```bash
story write http > http.story
```

Let's take a look:

```bash
cat http.story
```

```coffeescript
when http server listen method: "get" path: "/" as request
    request write content: "Hello world!"
```
> It's just a simple http server but a great starting point to just get *something* working. We have many other simple and complex examples [here](https://github.com/storyscript/examples).

## Deploy to Storyscript Cloud

The Storyscript Cloud is a microservice and function platform that uses Kubernetes and other cloud-native tooling as a fully managed microservice orchestration runtime. Simple put, **Storyscript makes it easy to deploy and use microservices on Kubernetes.** üí™

Let's deploy your story:

```bash
story deploy
```

üéâ Congratulations! You have just deployed your first Story!

::: tip What just happened behind the scene?

The output from your deployment will share some details about what happened, because it's quite amazing!

1. Storyscript is **strongly-typed**, therefore your stories were verified and syntax checked before deploying.
1. Services are pulled from the [Hub](https://hub.storyscript.io) and deployed to Kubernetes pods.
1. *Coming soon!* Functions were packaged in containers and deployed as services like above.
1. Services were started, events subscribed and ingress routes assigned.
1. The Storyscript Runtime caches your story for fast execution, acting as a microservice orchestrator.

The above would have mostly been manual work, typically in the form of Kubernetes configuration files which are automatically generated during deployment in the Storyscript Cloud.

## Putting it all together

A quick introduction to how the Storyscript platform works.

The **Stroyscript language** is a new language designed for business-logic which describes the flow of data between services. It **does not replace any other language**; is unites all other languages in a polyglot development platform being the most inclusive programming language. The language was inspired by many other languages giving it a natural and intuitive familiarity. It's **strongly-typed** and compiled into the Storyscript cloud-native runtime. We call this **top-level coding with a cloud-native programming language**.

The **Storyscript runtime** is a cloud-native orchestrator that **uses Kubernetes under-the-hood** as the container scheduler framework. The runtime will transform your stories into a cached model of instructions that simply moves data between the services. Think `IF this THAN that`, `WHEN this DO that`, `WAIT for this THEN that`, `WHILE this DO that` and all the `this thats` are services.

**Services** are independent components of highly-reusable software: a Docker container, OpenAPI spec, AsyncAPI specs, a single high-level language function, or another Storyscript. Developer are empowered to build polyglot applications by choosing any programming language to do the heavy lifting while Storyscript describes the interactions between these services. Services use the [Open Microservice Guide](https://microservice.guide/) to be free to make their own choices on language, protocol, serialization while providing consistent well-documented and domain-specific events and actions of the service. 

**Storyscript Platform** is the combination of the language, runtime, tooling and library of services. A fully-distributed, cloud-native monolith for rapid application development with zero-devops deployments into Kubernetes.

Our documentation provides more details on the philosophy and components that, together, we call Storyscript. We invite you to look around and discover our product.
